# Kaggle Competition: Digit Recognizer

This repository contains my solution to the [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer) competition on Kaggle, focused on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

The goal of this competition is to correctly classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. The dataset contains grayscale images of handwritten digits, each 28x28 pixels.

## Modeling

The following models were implemented and compared:

- **Random Forest**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **Histogram Gradient Boosting**

### Top Performing Models:
- Three models achieved an accuracy of over **0.96** on the validation set.
